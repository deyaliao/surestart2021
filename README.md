reflections  
2/8: i'm excited to join surestart to learn more about AI/ML! as these fields are relatively new, i think it's super valuable to understand how to use tech as a means of social change in today's technologically-dependent world. and, as an avid artist, i'm always looking for ways to learn how to creatively achieve my vision!   
2/9: 1. supervised vs unsupervised learning: for unsupervised, you let the computer find hidden patterns in a dataset, where new correlations can give you new insight about the data you have. for supervised, you feed data into the computer, which serves as a way to "train" the computer to make its own decisions in the future.
