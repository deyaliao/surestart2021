2/8: I'm excited to join surestart to learn more about AI/ML! As these fields are relatively new, I think it's super valuable to understand how to use tech as a means of social change in today's technologically-dependent world. And, as an avid artist, i'm always looking for ways to learn how to creatively achieve my vision.   
2/9: 
1. Supervised vs unsupervised learning: for unsupervised, you let the computer find hidden patterns in a dataset, where new correlations can give you new insight about the data you have. For supervised, you feed data into the computer, which serves as a way to "train" the computer to make its own decisions in the future.   
2. Scikit learn is solely focused on data modeling; it has no involvement with the actual manipulation or visualization of data, so one should use scikit learn along with these other analysis libraries.  

2/10: Today, I read over 2 articles as an introduction to basic ML concepts and model development. I also built my first neural network using tensorflow.   
1. A tensor is a multidimensional array that mathematically depicts a physical entity. We can better understand what a tensor is through its relation to scalars and vectors: scalars is a simple quantity/magnitude, and vectors are scalars with direction. They both are used to represent a physical quantity; likewise, tensors are essentially an array of multiple vectors, allowing mathematically representing data up to N dimensions. In machine learning, data is often multi-dimensional (such as images), and tensors are a data structure that mathematically encodes the data in a way for the computer to understand. This is an integral part to developing neural network models.   
2. I noticed the running the computations returned an array, which was a mathematical representation of the image. As I worked through the tutorial, I understood that one had to study and manipulate the data first (rescale images, convert to greyscale) in order to even start feeding the data into our neural network.
